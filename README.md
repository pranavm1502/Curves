# Curves
Inspired by Achtung die kurve game.
Written in Python (3.4) with use of the Pygame library.
(Adapted from janowskipio/FarBy on Github)

Right now it allows one or three players mode. But only one player mode works properly. (The goal destination is not shown on the screen as of now)

Have fun playing the game and feel free to change and submit the code ;)

**Rules**

Get to the end goal in a fixed number of steps without touching any curve

**Controls**

Player1 (RED): Left, Right (keys)

Player2 (GREEN): a, s

Player3 (BLUE): k, l

**Win Example**
